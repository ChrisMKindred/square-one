# Implementing Gravity Forms Styling

There are many different Form-builder plugins WordPress.  For our purposes, we've chosen [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/). 

All of our Gravity Forms styling builds on top of the Square One base form styling, so you'll definitely want to [implement
the base form styling](/docs/theme/forms/base.md) prior to beginning any type of Gravity Forms implementation.
